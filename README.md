# Rock-Paper-Scissors-V1

Pre-Work

#Step 1 is to have a function that returns a random value (Rock Paper Scissors). Two ways to do it
    1) Generate a random number and assign the number to (Rock Paper or Scissors)
    2) Have an array and randomly pick an item from the array.

#step 2 Create a function that will play one round of RPC
    1) Get user input and store into a variable.
    2) Use a method to make string case insensitive
    3) Compare Computer Selection vs player selection
    4) Return a string that explains who won



Post work

What difficulties did I have
    Looking at nested if statements was getting pretty unreadable.Which made it difficult to debug a missing bracket.

What went well?
    Using the switch statement for the first time was pretty smooth. (no difficulties)
    Defining and calling functions were pretty easy



What did I learn?
    To concatenate strings and variabels using String Interpolation. ie `my name is ${name}` 
    have to use back ticks (`) and not (")



What should I learn
    Should learn how to debug using debugger
    Can you use a switch statement to play rock paper scissors?
